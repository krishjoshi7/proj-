# Music Recommendation system by using Python and NLP


Creating a music recommender system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text descriptions and recommend music 

# Prerequisites !!
Building a music recommender system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques is a complex project that requires a combination of skills, tools, and resources. Here are the prerequisites that should be considered:

1. Programming Skills:
   - Proficiency in Python is essential since most NLP libraries and machine learning frameworks are available in Python.

2. Knowledge of NLP and Machine Learning:**
   - Understanding of NLP concepts like tokenization, text vectorization, and sentiment analysis.
   - Familiarity with machine learning algorithms and libraries such as sci-kit-learn, TensorFlow

3. Data Collection and Cleaning:
   - Data is been retrieved from Kaggel
   - Ability to preprocess and clean text data effectively.

4. Text Processing Libraries:
   - Familiarity with NLP libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) 

5. Machine Learning and Recommender Systems:
   - Understanding of different machine learning models and recommender system algorithms.
   - Knowledge of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.

6.  Data Analysis and Visualization:
   - Ability to analyze and visualize data to gain insights from music descriptions and user interactions.

7.  Text Vectorization Techniques:
   - Knowledge of techniques like Bag of Words (BoW)
    
8.  Hardware Resources:
    - Sufficient computing resources (CPU/GPU) for training and evaluating machine learning models, especially if working 
      with deep learning approaches.
