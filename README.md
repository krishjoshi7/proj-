# Music Recommendation system by using Python and NLP


Creating a music recommender system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text descriptions and recommend music 

# Prerequisites !!
Building a music recommender system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques is a complex project that requires a combination of skills, tools, and resources. Here are the prerequisites that should be considered:

1. Programming Skills:
   - Proficiency in Python is essential since most NLP libraries and machine learning frameworks are available in Python.

2. Knowledge of NLP and Machine Learning:**
   - Understanding of NLP concepts like tokenization, text vectorization, and sentiment analysis.
   - Familiarity with machine learning algorithms and libraries such as sci-kit-learn, TensorFlow

3. Data Collection and Cleaning:
   - Data is been retrieved from Kaggel
   - Ability to preprocess and clean text data effectively.

4. Text Processing Libraries:
   - Familiarity with NLP libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) 

5. Machine Learning and Recommender Systems:
   - Understanding of different machine learning models and recommender system algorithms.
   - Knowledge of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.

6.  Data Analysis and Visualization:
    - Ability to analyze and visualize data to gain insights from music descriptions and user interactions.

7.  Text Vectorization Techniques:
     - Knowledge of techniques like Bag of Words (BoW)
    
8.  Hardware Resources:
    - Sufficient computing resources (CPU/GPU) for training and evaluating machine learning models, especially if working 
      with deep learning approaches.
## Working Of project ##

**Importing Data**
  The initial and pivotal step entails acquiring the requisite dataset,
  a foundational imperative in any machine learning endeavor. 
  For this project, the data has been imported from the Kaggle platform.
  link:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset

 **Loading Dataset**
  Using the pandas' library from Python
  To load csv dataset into pandas dataframe 

 **Data Analysis** 
   To check for missing values in the dataset.
   To check if any inconsistency in the dataset.

 **Text Preprocessing**
 Step 1:- Lowerall the words in our dataset so that every word can get equal weightage
 Step 2:- We remove Noises from the dataset such as 
 as HTML tags, URL 
 ***Reason***:-
 The presence of such elements within our dataset has the potential to induce inaccuracies in our model's predictions.

 **Tokenization**
 We use Tokenization cause the computer does not understand Human language.
 It understands Numbers more precisely as "Binary"

 We can do n Tokenization by assigning each word or sentence a token(int/string)
 Which is then processed by our machine 

 **Converting Text and Token into vector**
 IMPORTING & WORKING with TWO MOST IMPORTANT LIBRARY IN NLP 
 
 TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text:

 TfidfVectorizer is a class in Scikit-Learn used for converting a collection of raw text documents into numerical features 
 that can be used for machine learning. It stands for "Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency Vectorizer."

 This component is crucial for transforming textual data into a format suitable for various machine learning algorithms. It 
 calculates the TF-IDF values for words or terms in the text, representing how important each word is in a document relative 
 to a collection of documents (corpus).

 from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity:

This line imports the cosine_similarity function from the sklearn.metrics.pairwise module, as explained earlier. It's used to measure the cosine similarity between vectors.

 Overall, this code prepares your text data by applying TF-IDF vectorization and then calculates the cosine similarity between the documents. The resulting similarity scores can be used for various purposes, such as finding similar documents or, in the context of a recommender system, identifying similar music descriptions or items for recommendations.

**Creating Music Recommendation System**
So, when you call this recommender function with a song name as an argument,
it will find the most similar songs to the input song and return a list of recommended songs 
based on their cosine similarity score


**CONCLUSION**
The document serves as a guide and explanation for anyone interested in understanding the project's objectives, prerequisites, workflow, and key components.
It also briefly justifies the importance of each step in the project's success.
